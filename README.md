# Endless Sky Game Editor

Simple tool to edit [Endless Sky](https://endless-sky.github.io/)  game save files.

I love this game so much, it's always really fun to tinker around with unobtainable ships, unlimited money, blocked missions and much more. 

Why spend 5 seconds editting a simple text file when you can spend 5 days making a text file _editor_. You're welcome.
